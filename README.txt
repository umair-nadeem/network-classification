This file describes the folders and their contents.

The following is the list of the 4 folders:

1. "src"
	This folder contains the python and bash scripts for data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms implementations. 
	There are some scripts are that just 'scratch' scripts and not useful for generating the results. However, those are
	included as well. The 'network' folder has the neural network implementations and the grid search for optimization. The
	series folder has implementations for exponential smoothing and arima. It also has implementations for tree based methods
	i.e. GBDT and Random Forests. The server folder contains the scratch scripts. The remaining scripts are for data preprocessing
	and general pipeline scripts.

2. "data"
	This folder contains two subfolders. The subfolder 'Classification Data' has the xml files for classification task. It was
	obtained and is property of Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity at University of New Brunswick, Canada. The subfolder
	'Prediction Data' has two further folders. The folder 'Raw Data' has the csv files for data obtained from Waikato and Wide
	projects in New Zealand and Japan respectively. The folder 'Final Prediction CSVs' contains the final csv files for real, 
	short, and middle term series.

3. "papers
	This folder contains the research papers used for background study for both classification and prediction tasks.

4. "rep"
	This folder contains the final pdf thesis document and the source files along with the final presentation/thesis defense.
