meeting 1 - 08th Jan
which models to use? for forecasting? for classification? SMA, Exponential Smoothing, NN, ARIMA, Regression
How much data to use, e.g. for simple linear regression?
what time unit to use?
which packets to look for tcp? udp? dns?
what is the forecasted volume unit? packets? frame length?
forecasting or classification?
Data shuffling?



meeting 2
prediction is time series and classification is not?
how to interpret non-number features? ip addresses? protocols?
which ports are we interested in? src? dst?
which protocols are important? tcp.seq? tcp.stream? tcp.window_size? ip.ttl? 


last meeting
using 3 time series prediction methods. using 3/4 ML models
making a range of hyperparameters and complexity of models. and plotting results with extreme and intermediate values
performance metrics and confidence values
classification with one data trace for protocol values. using time delta, frame len, ip addresses
